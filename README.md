## 🧭 Overview

PlacementGPT-AI takes a candidate from *"here's my resume"* to *"here's your interview-readiness report"* in one pipeline. A resume is parsed and scored, benchmarked against the real skill requirements of a target role, turned into a personalised mock interview, graded answer-by-answer by an LLM acting as a strict technical interviewer, and finally exported as a downloadable PDF — with every session persisted for later review.

Under the hood, resume analysis runs as a single **LangGraph** state machine that blends rule-based scoring, sentence-embedding similarity, and Groq-hosted **Llama 3.3 70B** calls — with four analysis agents (profile, stats, ATS, skill-gap) fanned out to run **in parallel** to keep latency down.

The app is split into two independently deployable services: a **Streamlit** multipage frontend and a **FastAPI** backend, connected over plain HTTP.

## 🎯 Features

<details open>
<summary><strong>📄 Resume Analysis</strong></summary>

Upload a PDF resume and the pipeline extracts and structures it end to end:

- **Text extraction** via PyMuPDF, with whitespace/line-noise cleanup
- **Section parsing** — education, skills, projects, experience, certifications (heading-based)
- **Skill extraction** — regex matching against a curated skill vocabulary
- **Candidate profile & stats** — skill counts, section-presence flags

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>🎯 ATS Scoring</strong></summary>

| Output | What it tells you |
|--------|-------------------|
| Resume Score | Rule-based score (0–100) across skills, education, experience, projects, certifications |
| ATS Score | Hybrid score — semantic keyword match (60%) + resume score (40%), then refined by an LLM pass |
| Matched / Missing Skills | Semantic comparison against the target role's required-skill list, not just exact string matches |
| Keyword Match % | Percentage of required skills found (exactly or semantically) in the resume |
| Recommendations | Actionable, LLM-generated fixes |

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>🧠 Semantic Skill Gap Analysis</strong></summary>

Resume skills and role requirements are embedded with **Sentence-Transformers** (`all-MiniLM-L6-v2`) and compared with cosine similarity, so `"TensorFlow"` on a resume can correctly satisfy a requirement for `"Deep Learning"` frameworks — not just literal string matches. Supports **12 target roles** out of the box (see [Supported Roles](#-supported-roles)).

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>✨ Resume Improvement Suggestions</strong></summary>

A single Groq LLM call returns structured, section-by-section improvement ideas: summary rewrites, stronger project bullets, experience phrasing, skill-keyword additions, and ATS-specific formatting fixes.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>🎤 AI Mock Interview</strong></summary>

- **Personalised questions** generated from the *candidate's own* resume — skills, projects, experience, and target role — at Easy / Medium / Hard difficulty
- **Live countdown timer** widget embedded in the interview page
- **On-demand follow-up questions** — the interviewer probes deeper into a specific answer before moving on

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>📊 Strict AI Interview Evaluation</strong></summary>

Every answer is graded by an LLM instructed to behave like a strict FAANG interviewer (empty, evasive, or "I don't know" answers are explicitly scored 0 — no credit for effort):

| Metric | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Technical Score | Depth & accuracy across all answers |
| Communication Score | Clarity and structure of responses |
| Per-question Feedback | Score, critique, and an ideal answer for every question |
| Strengths / Weaknesses | At least two of each, generated per session |
| Learning Roadmap | A week-by-week study plan targeting the detected gaps |

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>📑 PDF Assessment Reports</strong></summary>

One click on the Feedback page generates a downloadable PDF (via ReportLab) combining the resume analysis, ATS breakdown, skill gap, and full interview feedback into a single report.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>🗄️ Persistent Interview History</strong></summary>

Every evaluated interview is saved to a database (SQLite locally by default, or PostgreSQL in production — see [Environment Variables](#-environment-variables)) and browsable from the History page: scores, strengths/weaknesses, roadmap, and per-question feedback for every past session.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>⚖️ Resume Comparator</strong></summary>

Upload two resume versions for the same role and get a side-by-side breakdown: resume/ATS score deltas, detected-skill differences, missing-skill lists for each version, and an LLM-generated verdict on which version to submit — plus advice on combining the best of both.

</details>

## 🏗️ Architecture & LangGraph Workflow

PlacementGPT-AI runs as **two decoupled services**:

```
┌───────────────────────┐        HTTP (BACKEND_URL)       ┌────────────────────────────┐
│   Streamlit Frontend   │ ───────────────────────────────►│      FastAPI Backend       │

```

Every `/analyze-resume` request is a single invocation of a **LangGraph `StateGraph`** built around a shared `PlacementState` TypedDict:

```

```

### Node reference

| Node | Execution | Responsibility |
|------|-----------|-----------------|
| `sections` | Sequential | Splits the cleaned resume text into education / skills / projects / experience / certifications using heading-based line matching |
| `skills` | Sequential | Extracts a deduplicated skill list from the skills section by matching against `data/skills/skills.csv` |
| `verification` | Sequential | Flags the resume invalid if no skills, education, or experience text was parsed — guards against unreadable uploads |
| `dispatch` / `aggregator` | Fan-out / Fan-in | No-op sync nodes: `dispatch` triggers the four parallel branches; `aggregator` waits for all four before continuing |
| `profile` | **Parallel** | Builds a structured candidate profile (skills, total count, section-presence flags) |
| `stats` | **Parallel** | Computes resume statistics (skill count, education/experience/certification flags) |
| `ats` | **Parallel** | Computes `resume_score`, `ats_score`, a score breakdown, and ATS analysis — hybrid of rule-based scoring, semantic matching, and an LLM refinement pass |
| `skill_gap` | **Parallel** | Compares resume skills to the target role's required-skill matrix via sentence-embedding cosine similarity |
| `improvements` | Sequential | Single Groq call returning structured resume-improvement suggestions |
| `questions` | Sequential | Single Groq call generating personalised, resume-grounded interview questions at the chosen difficulty |
| `fallback` | Terminal | Returns safe zero-value defaults when `verification` fails, so the API never errors out on a bad upload |

### Why the parallel stage matters

Before fan-out, profile → stats → ATS → skill-gap ran as four sequential steps. `dispatch` now triggers all four simultaneously, and `aggregator` only lets the pipeline proceed once every branch has written its results back into the shared state — cutting pipeline latency without changing a single agent's logic.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+ (the Docker image uses 3.11)
- A [Groq API key](https://console.groq.com/) (free tier available)
- *(Optional)* A PostgreSQL connection string (e.g. [Neon](https://neon.tech/) or [Supabase](https://supabase.com/)) if you want persistent storage beyond local SQLite

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MohitParmar78/PlacementGPT-AI.git
cd PlacementGPT-AI
```

### 2. Create a virtual environment

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate      # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 3. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

> `sentence-transformers` pulls in PyTorch. The first run will also download the `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` embedding model (~90 MB) automatically.

### 4. Configure environment variables

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# then edit .env and add your GROQ_API_KEY
```

---

## 🔑 Environment Variables

| Variable | Required | Default | Purpose |
|----------|----------|---------|---------|
| `GROQ_API_KEY` | **Yes** | — | Powers every LLM call: ATS refinement, resume improvements, question generation, follow-ups, interview grading, and resume comparison |
| `DATABASE_URL` | No | `sqlite:///./data/placementgpt.db` | Point this at a PostgreSQL URI to persist interview history in production; omit it to use the local SQLite file |
| `BACKEND_URL` | No (frontend only) | `http://localhost:8000` | Read by the Streamlit pages to locate the FastAPI backend — set this when the two services are deployed separately |
| `MODEL_NAME` | No | n/a — agents currently hardcode `llama-3.3-70b-versatile` | Present in `.env.example`/`settings.py`, reserved for future configurability |
| `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `CHROMA_DB_PATH` | No | — | Loaded in `settings.py` but not yet wired into any agent — reserved for future use |

> **Tip:** never commit `.env` — it's already excluded in `.gitignore`.

---

## ▶️ Running the Application

The frontend and backend are two independent processes — run each in its own terminal.

### 1. Start the FastAPI backend

```bash
uvicorn backend.api.main:app --reload
```

- API → `http://127.0.0.1:8000`
- Interactive Swagger docs → `http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs`
- The `interview_sessions` table is created automatically on first launch — no manual migration needed.

### 2. Start the Streamlit frontend

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

- App → `http://localhost:8501`

If the backend is deployed elsewhere, point the frontend at it before launching:

```bash
export BACKEND_URL="https://your-backend-host"
streamlit run app.py
```

## 📡 API Reference

| Method | Path | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `GET` | `/` | Health check — returns `{"message": "Backend Running"}` |
| `POST` | `/analyze-resume` | Upload a PDF (`resume`) + `target_role` + `difficulty`; runs the full LangGraph pipeline and returns sections, skills, stats, scores, skill gap, improvements, profile, and generated questions |
| `POST` | `/compare-resumes-llm` | Takes two already-analyzed resumes (`resume_a_data`, `resume_b_data`) and returns an LLM verdict, per-resume strengths, a comparison summary, and actionable advice |
| `POST` | `/evaluate-interview` | Grades a completed interview (question/skill/answer triples) with a strict LLM pass, persists the session, and returns full feedback |
| `POST` | `/generate-followup` | Generates one deeper follow-up question based on a candidate's answer |
| `GET` | `/history?limit=10` | Returns the most recent interview sessions from the database |

Full interactive documentation (request/response schemas) is available at `/docs` once the backend is running.

---

## 🎓 Supported Roles

`data/roles/role_skills.json` ships a required-skill matrix used by both the ATS scorer and the skill-gap agent, covering **12 target roles**:

`Machine Learning Engineer` · `Data Scientist` · `Data Analyst` · `Backend Developer` · `Frontend Developer` · `Full Stack Developer` · `Software Engineer` · `GenAI Engineer` · `Deep Learning Engineer` · `DevOps Engineer` · `Cloud Engineer` · `AI Research Engineer`

Adding a new role only requires adding a new key and skill list to that JSON file — no code changes needed.

---

## 🗃️ Data Assets

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `data/skills/skills.csv` | Canonical skill vocabulary used for regex-based extraction from the resume's skills section |
| `data/roles/role_skills.json` | Required-skill matrix for the 12 supported roles |
| `data/questions/questions.json` | A static, skill-grouped seed question bank bundled as reference data — interview questions are generated live per resume by the question agent, so this file isn't loaded at runtime today |

---

## 🐳 Docker Deployment

The included `Dockerfile` containerizes the **FastAPI backend only**. The Streamlit frontend is designed to be deployed separately (e.g. Streamlit Community Cloud) and pointed at the container's public URL via `BACKEND_URL`.

```bash
docker build -t placementgpt-backend .
docker run -p 8000:8000 --env-file .env placementgpt-backend
```

Notable details baked into the image:

- Installs a **CPU-only PyTorch wheel** before the rest of `requirements.txt`, avoiding multi-GB CUDA libraries that would blow past free-tier build limits
- Respects an injected `PORT` environment variable (defaults to `8000`) — ready to drop onto platforms like [Northflank](https://northflank.com/) that assign their own port at runtime

---

## 🧪 Testing

`tests/` contains small, standalone verification scripts for the core modules (embedding, semantic matching, skill gap, the LangGraph workflow, follow-up questions, resume improvements, and PDF report generation). They exercise a function or class against a hard-coded example and print the result, rather than asserting via `pytest`. Run any of them directly:

```bash
python -m tests.test_matcher
python -m tests.test_langgraph
python -m tests.test_report
```

Use these as smoke tests during development, or as a starting point for a formal `pytest` suite.
